`Project Description`

In this project, we tackle the complex task of text style transfer, focusing on transforming between
Shakespearean English and modern news language. Employing a multifaceted approach, we experimented
with directly prompting pre-trained GPT and T5 models, fine-tuning T5 for style swapping, and
deploying dual encoders for distinct content and style extraction. Our methods also included latent vector
splitting using T5 in conjunction with a pretrained-adversarial network, aiming to differentiate content
and style vectors effectively. Finally, our team successfully extracted the features of two different styles
by latent vector splitting and dual encoder methods, but we still need to make efforts to improve the
readability of generated sentences.
